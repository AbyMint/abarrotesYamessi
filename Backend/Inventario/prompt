Build a simple inventory management web app using **FastAPI** with a clean and minimal UI. The app must be accessible from both desktop and phone browsers on the same local network.

**Requirements:**

* Database: SQLite (first version).
* Use SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM for models.
* Provide full CRUD operations for:

  1. Products
  2. Suppliers
  3. Inventory movements (entries, sales, adjustments)
* Product stock must not be edited directly. Stock must change only through inventory movements.
* Create REST API endpoints and simple HTML templates using Jinja2 (or FastAPI's template system).
* UI should be a basic form-style layout, easy to use.
* Include search and filter in product and movement lists.

**Database schema:**

```
products(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  sku TEXT UNIQUE,
  name TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  subcategory TEXT,
  cost_price REAL,
  sale_price REAL,
  stock INTEGER
)

suppliers(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  contact TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  address TEXT
)

inventory_movements(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INTEGER,
  type TEXT,           -- "entry", "sale", "adjustment"
  quantity INTEGER,
  date TEXT,
  supplier_id INTEGER,
  notes TEXT
)
```

**Pages needed:**

* Product list with search + edit and delete buttons.
* Add product form.
* Supplier list + add supplier form.
* Inventory movement form (entry or sale).
* List of inventory movements with filters (by product or date).

**Output format:**

1. Project folder structure
2. Code for main.py, models, routes, templates
3. Instructions to run the server and access from a phone on the same WiFi
